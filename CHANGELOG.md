## 6.0.0 (2017-11-27)

### Breaking changes

- On Windows this cookbook now uses the Chocolatey package manager to install Strawberry Perl instead of downloading the zip file and manually installing it. This does require chocolatey to first be installed on the system and will use the C:\strawberry\perl path

### Other Changes

- Removed build-essential from the Berksfile since it wasn't needed there
- Fixed cpan_module resource to work on Windows as well

- Enable FC016 testing again
- Use the latest cpanm which has 4 years of bug fixes and enhancements

## 5.2.1 (2017-08-30)

- Do not use an explicit owner and group on Windows. Let Chef do the right thing here which prevents breakage when the Administrator account has been renamed

## 5.2.0 (2017-05-06)

- Fix license string to be a SPDX standard license string
- Simplify true/false statement

- Test with Local Delivery instead of Rake
- Use the root_group attribute from Ohai instead of defining it ourselves
- Use multi-package to speed up installs in the default recipe
- Don't use "module" as a resource property since its reserved. Instead use module_name and wire it up so a user can actually define a module name here instead of the module name coming from the name of the resource

## 5.0.0 (2017-02-27)
